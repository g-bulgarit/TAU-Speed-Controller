## How to use:
1. Clone this repository or download it
2. Go to [Chrome extension Control Panel](chrome://extensions) - chrome://extensions

3. **Turn on developer mode** on the top right
4. Click on **"Load unpacked"** and select the Unicko-Speed-Controller folder.
5. An icon will now appear in the top part of the chrome browser, clicking it will show some buttons that control the playback speed of your boring lectures.

## Why so complicated?
Google wants 5$ for a developer account to save all this trouble.\
I say - nah.

Gotta go fast!
